# Machine Learning models for AQI values

Instances of fatalities along with diseases due to air pollution turn out to be growing every year. WHOâ€™s 2018 report states that around six to seven million people die each and every year as a result of diseases attributable to air contamination. Thus it is extremely important to precisely monitor and anticipate the grades of contaminants in the surrounding air. 

In this project, we find the AQI of an area using Machine Learning algorithms like Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. Then we compare these models based on error metrics such as Coefficient of Determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).

The results showed that RFR performed the best among the regression algorithms, MLR and DTR both performed well while the performance of SVR was bad.
